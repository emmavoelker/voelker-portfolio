Emma's Data Visualization Portfolio

## About Me 
Hi everyone! My name is Emma, (she/her pronouns), and I'm an arts management master's student enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. I will be graduating with my degree in the Spring! This portfolio is created for a data visualization class I am taking this semester. 

I have a background in marketing and communications, and am excited to learn more about data visualization! 

## What I Hope to Learn
In this course, I hope to learn more about creating impactful and well-designed data visualizations. As a student looking to go into marketing after graduation, I hope to gain knowledge of how to convey data to an audience in a way that is thoughtful and meaningful. The world of marketing, especially when it comes to aspects like campaign tracking and reporting, is full of data. It will prove very helpful if I am able to navigate data visualization in a way that is helpful to my colleagues and audiences.
